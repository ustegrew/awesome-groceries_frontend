# `AwesomeGroceries.com`

`AwesomeGroceries` is a company selling groceries. They tasked us to create an online presence for them. Their online presence must allow customers to

  1. browse products
  2. view details of any product
  3. buy multiple products
  4. auto update product information in-session.
  
  
Other requirements we got from them:

  1. Simple use. Purchase of one product should be doable with a minimum of three mouse clicks.
  2. Fast loading. If the website runs locally, each page should display in two seconds or less.
  3. Reactive. Any user action should result in some immediate feedback. For example, if the customer requests a page there should be an indicator that something is being loaded.
