/*
[100]: The shopping cart counter is absolute with respect to the shopping cart button.
       To accomplish this we have to set the position of the enclosing element to
       'relative' - otherwise, the shopping cart counter will be absolute with respect to
       the document body. On the enclosing element we'll also omit any further position
       setting (such as 'left', 'top') as this will leave them at their default value
       (zero).

       Quote (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp):
           An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
           positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
           However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors,
           it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
           Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static
