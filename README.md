# The awesomegroceries online company

... which doesn't actually exist. It's a learning project, and I hope to learn:

  * [Spring](https://spring.io)
  * [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org)
  * [Angular](https://angular.io)

This project is the UI frontend. It's been generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Roadmap, entire dev (i.e. front/backend)

I'm aware that there won't be real customers as our company is ficticious, but lets just pretend there will be customers. The development is purposely client (i.e. customer) driven as we would like to implement the features that customers need. Therefore - UI comes first.

1. Develop the front end. We'll use mock services to simulate the backend. We'll also use this first stage to determine the needs for the data model.
2. Develop the data model. With the first step in the can I should have a fairly good idea what the customer needs.
3. Develop the backend. This will be a separate project (based on Tomcat) and will open the Spring and Hibernate world.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
